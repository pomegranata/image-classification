# Image Classification with Jupyter Notebook: Rock, Paper, Scissors
Welcome to the Image Classification project that focuses on classifying images of rock, paper, and scissors. This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to build an image classifier using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn patterns from image data and classify images into one of the three categories: rock, paper, or scissors.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification model capable of distinguishing between images of rock, paper, and scissors. By employing deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, the model learns to identify unique features in the images that differentiate one category from another. This project is a practical example of applying machine learning to solve real-world problems and can serve as a foundation for more complex image classification tasks.

Objectives
To explore and preprocess image data for machine learning.
To design and train a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
To evaluate the model's performance and improve accuracy.
To deploy the model for making predictions on new image data.
Features
Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: Handles image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
Flexible Model Architecture: Utilizes CNNs with configurable layers to experiment with different network designs.
Performance Evaluation: Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for thorough evaluation.
Interactive Visualizations: Provides tools for visualizing model performance and prediction results.
Deployment Ready: Prepares the model for deployment with options for exporting the trained model.
Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of images of hands showing rock, paper, and scissors gestures. It can be sourced from Kaggle's Rock Paper Scissors Dataset or other similar repositories. The dataset includes:

Rock Images: Images depicting the rock gesture.
Paper Images: Images depicting the paper gesture.
Scissors Images: Images depicting the scissors gesture.
Each category has a balanced number of images to ensure fair training and evaluation of the model.
